### The Challenge:

This is a .NET 8 Blazor Web App with Global Server interactivity.

We have defined a CascadingAppState component and made it available to all components in the app.

We have also defined a scoped service called StorageService and injected it into Home.razor.

How can we access the CascadingAppState component INSIDE the StorageService?

See the commented code in StorageService to get an idea of what we want to do.
